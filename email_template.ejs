  <p>Hey <%= firstName %>,</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been like <%= monthsSinceContact %> months
    since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying 
    my time.  Is this your email by the way? <%= emailAddress %>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
    Check out my latest posts here: 
    <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href="<%= latestPosts[i].link %>"> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
  </p>

    Also, I just created a little guessing game that you can play and test out!
